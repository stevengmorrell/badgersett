Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in

and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
